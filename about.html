            <h1>Why Coding?</h1>

            <p>Roughly ten years ago, when I had just finished my studies in arts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreesen</a> determined, <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"><q>Software is eating the world</q></a>, a passionate commentary on the value and great potential of internet companies and digital technologies.<br> Growing up in Germany, one of the world's largest industry-based economies, I then didn't share Andreesen's optimism. But I have always been what is commonly referred to as "tech-savvy". I was interested in computers early on and started building my own setups as a teenager. It just never got me to a place where I seriously learned how to write code, let alone programs. <br>It took time to fully understand the significance of new, digital technologies in every aspect of our lifes and existence. Especially our growing ability to harness ridiculous ammounts of data to inform decissions seems to me a key driver of technological growth. I think there is no better place to feel and experience this influence than Israel, the Start-Up Nation where technology is buzzing. Together with some Corona-related downtime, this seems the best time to learn how to code and create applications and programs that contribute to Andreesen's vision</p>

          <div class="Experience">
            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>
              When I feel like confusing people I just tell them that I am a historian, which is actually true. I studied Business History, also Political Science and Philosophy at the <a href="https://www.philo.hhu.de/en/"> University in D&uuml;sseldorf</a>.<br> That said, already before and during my studies I worked in the private sector, first it was simple service-related jobs but soon enough I was managing products, projects and teams in different geographies and industries. In between I did academic research on German - American relations in retail, which gave me the opportunity to travel the US and develop a new appreciation for the country.<br>
              And now I am becoming a programmer - how does that fit together. Well, as mentioned before, I have had this fascination about computers and technology early on. I guess I didn't have enough inspiration to pursue a career in that area and I had conflicting interests. You can't do everything. While I certainly have an interesting and versatile career path, I'd like to think of it as a strength that enables me to look at problems from different angles. This has helped tremendously as a Product Manager and surely will help me as a programmer.

            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>
              Nothing out of the ordinary really. I love music, all kinds of genres from Jazz to Metal. I used to play the guitar, bass and the drums (if had to be) during jam sesisons with friends. Long time ago, good memories. <br>
              I am into sports, basically any ball sport - you name it. When I am not actively doing sports I definitely feel I am missing out. Currently I am having weekly games of tennis and basketball. If you're into table tennis by any chance, let's hook up!<br> 
              Since this seems to be a prerequisite for being welcome in high-tech, I am happy to share that I am into sci-fi as well. I used to read a lot (across genre's though) but with all the technical documentation I am reading and writing it's more motion pictures these days.<br>
              My family is more than just an interest of course, so it feels wrong to list it here. I cannot leave them out either, since they are the center of my life.

            <p id="Dusseldorf Germany">From my home town in the South, Stuttgart, also known as "Benztown", to D&uuml;sseldorf in the West where I lived most of my adult life and a stint in Berlin in the North/East. 
            I've definitely come around in Germany.</p>
            <li>USA</li>
            <p id="New York City USA" class="hidden">Again, traveling and working in different places, such as Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia but mostly in New York City. 
            What a city - definitely among the most exciting times of my life!</p>
            <li>Israel</li>
            <p id="Kfar Saba Israel" class="hidden">Eventually landed in Israel, my wife's country of origin. First in Givatayim and then for family business to Kfar Saba.
            What an amazingly versatile, inspiring and also messy country. Great place to learn about and from Hi-Tech!</p>
            <li>New Zealand</li>
            <p id="Wellington New Zealand" class="hidden">Never say never, so why not New Zealand with it's abundant flora and fauna, friendly people and a more laid-back atmosphere.</p>
